# FirstFlask
Messing around with Flask for the first time. Will store a few bags of tricks here as i go.


## Getting Started
In VSCode 
- clone the repository
- create a virtual env and activate it
```
.venv\scripts\Activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run from the command line
```
set FLASK_APP=FirstFlask.py
flask run
```

open a browser on localhost port 5000: http://localhost:5000
